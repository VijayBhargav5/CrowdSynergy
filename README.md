# Crowd Synergy: YOLO meets ByteTracker

This paper proposed a method to count people or objects entering or exiting a certain area under certain conditions such as crossing an imaginary line using advanced one-stage object detection YOLOv8. It is assumed that each object is counted and does not miss any object. Every bounding box that crosses a line in one way is defined as an object going in and the total count is incremented. A bounding box that crosses the line in the opposite direction is considered an object going out and the total count should be decremented. The proposed methodology ensures that it has less computational overhead and no objects are missed by one-stage detection. Here, the accuracy of the bounding box of one-stage object detection demonstrates better detection and less false positives. This ensures that not only all objects detected are counted but also that no object present in the feed is missed.
