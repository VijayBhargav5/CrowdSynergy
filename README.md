# Crowd Synergy: YOLO meets ByteTracker#

This paper proposed a method to count people or objects enter-ing or exiting a certain area under certain conditions such as crossing an imaginary line using advanced one-stage object de-tection YOLOv8. It is assumed that each object is counted and does not miss any object. Every bounding box that crosses a line in one way is defined as an object going in and the total count is incremented. A bounding box that crosses the line in the oppo-site direction is considered an object going out and the total count should be decremented. The proposed methodology en-sures that it has less computational overhead and no objects are missed by one-stage detection. Here, the accuracy of the bound-ing box of one-stage object detection demonstrates better detec-tion and less false positives. This ensures that not only all ob-jects detected are counted but also that no object present in the feed is missed.
